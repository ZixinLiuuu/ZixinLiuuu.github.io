<h1>Findings & Discussion</h1>
</section>
<section id="social" class="level2">
  <h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social">Social Performance</h2>
  <p>
    After a thorough analysis of Amazon's social network, we have identified several key findings:
    Firstly, Amazon's diverse businesses are reflected in its network of subsidiaries spread across the globe. These subsidiaries, spanning sectors like cloud computing (such as AWS), e-commerce, and digital media, demonstrate Amazon's business versatility. In terms of social media strategy, this diversity is represented through customized content and communication approaches tailored for different customer segments.
  </p>
  <p>
      Secondly, Amazon's international business strategy is evident in its social network's global coverage. Nodes representing subsidiaries in various countries and regions, such as Amazon.CA, Amazon.IT, Amazon.FR, etc., not only highlight Amazon's international influence but also reflect its regionally adapted and culturally sensitive social media tactics.
  </p>
  <p>
      Moreover, Amazon's social connections with numerous global partners underscore its critical role in the supply chain and business ecosystem. On social media, this might manifest through collaborative marketing, cross-promotion, and content sharing to enhance brand visibility and strengthen business relationships.
  </p>
  <p>
      Simultaneously, Amazon's ties with Prime Video and other media-related entities indicate its investments and collaborations in the media and entertainment sector. This is likely reflected in its social media content strategy through the promotion of original content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our focused analysis on Amazon's activities during the epic year reveals significant insights into its performance across diverse sectors. We observed Amazon's agility in adapting to varying social and economic landscapes, reflected in its expansive and strategically diversified business operations. From cloud computing with AWS to dynamic strides in e-commerce and digital media, Amazon demonstrated remarkable versatility and innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its international business strategy, highlighted by its extensive global network of subsidiaries, showcased not only its wide-reaching influence but also its ability to implement culturally sensitive and region-specific approaches, particularly in social media engagement. Additionally, Amazon's strengthened ties with global partners and significant investments in the media and entertainment sectors, especially through Prime Video, underline its strategic focus on collaborative growth and content-driven customer engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This comprehensive research paints a picture of Amazon's robust and multifaceted performance in the epic year, emphasizing its pivotal role in the socio-economic spectrum and its adaptive, forward-thinking strategies.

    <strong>Different Analyses on Amazon’s Economic Performance and its Competitors</strong>
    <p>
      We are intrigued by Amazon's pivotal year in 2017 and aim to delve into its distinct performance across various dimensions during this notable period. In this section, our primary focus is on Amazon’s economic aspects, considering stock price as a pivotal indicator. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive analysis specifically centered around Amazon's stock prices to glean insights into its economic performance. We have conducted several analyses and the summarized results of these analyses are as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Basic Statistical Analysis section, we primarily focus on eBay as it closely mirrors Amazon's online shopping business nature, which constitutes the main source of Amazon's net sales. As online shopping companies, Amazon outperforms eBay in mean prices (open price, highest price, lowest price, close price, adj close price) and trading volumes, signaling stronger investor preference for Amazon's stock due to its higher overall performance. Additionally, Amazon's stock prices exhibit greater volatility (in the earlier stage of stock listing, Amazon’s stock prices were lower than eBay), with significantly higher maximum prices and a larger standard deviation compared to eBay. We could potentially infer that in recent years, Amazon's overall performance was better than eBay's in the eyes of investors. In the media-streaming and video-rental sector, Amazon's higher stock trading volume doesn't align with its economic performance. Investors seem to have more confidence in Netflix, indicated by significantly higher mean, mode, and maximum stock prices, along with a larger standard deviation. Thus, Netflix's economic performance appears to surpass that of Amazon in this segment. Although Amazon has ventured into the grocery segment, the net sales from physical stores, including Whole Foods Market, contribute only about 3.8% to its total net sales, which is relatively low. In contrast, both Target and Walmart predominantly operate in the Wholesale Retail Industry, with a substantial part of their revenue derived from the grocery segment and food & beverage sales. Hence, while we conducted a comparison between Amazon and Target/Walmart, details of this specific aspect of the basic statistical analysis can be found in the "Analyses" section and won't be reiterated here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Outlier Detection section, we employ Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for Close price outlier estimation. Three neighborhood sizes (k: 2, 10, 20) were tested. Outliers were identified using a 0.1 percentile threshold of outlier scores. We found that sensitivity to outliers decreased with higher k values, so some data initially classified as inliers might be reclassified as outliers with an increased k value. Despite detecting outliers, the decision was made not to remove them, recognizing their value in analyzing significant market events interesting to investors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Binning Strategy section, we employ a binning method to identify outliers and analyze the stock price trends based on the bin ranges in which the stock price falls during different time periods. We use an equal-width partition to understand the distribution of closing prices over time. From 2017 to 2021, Amazon witnessed substantial growth, followed by a decline in 2022. Analyzing the period from 2016 to 2023, stock prices were concentrated in the fourth bin range compared to when it first listed, suggesting significant growth and a positive investor outlook toward Amazon's economic performance. Similar to Amazon, eBay experienced a growth phase from 2017 to 2021, followed by a decline in 2022. Concentrating on the period from 2016 to 2023, eBay's stock prices were mainly in the fourth bin range. However, compared to Amazon, eBay exhibited less even distribution across bins 4 to 8, indicating a potentially less stable performance. Netflix's main growth occurred from 2017 to 2021, with a significant decline in 2022. Focusing on 2016 to 2023, stock prices concentrated in bins 2, 4, and 5. Although Netflix had fewer prices in bins 6 to 8 than Amazon, higher bin boundary numbers and similar distributions in bins 4 to 8 suggest Netflix's economic performance was better than Amazon's. For the same reasons mentioned earlier, while we compared Amazon with Target and Walmart, specific details regarding this aspect of the binning strategy for Target and Walmart are available in the "Analyses" section and will not be reiterated here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Correlation Analysis section, we present correlations in Date-Open Price, Date-Volume, Open-Close, High-Low, and Date-CloseOpenDiff scatterplots for Amazon and its competitors.  Amazon exhibited an overall upward trend in stock prices during this period, with the highest trading volume recorded in 2018, while the 'CloseOpenDiff vs. Date' scatterplot suggests increased post-market events (cash dividends, stock dividends, or stock splits) in 2022-2023, leading to larger deviations. eBay also experienced an upward trend in stock prices and experienced positive impacts from post-market events, while Netflix displayed an overall upward trend in stock prices, except for a significant drop in 2022, but faced significant negative events in 2022-2023. Target experienced a significant drop in stock prices from 2021 to 2023, but positive post-market impacts were more frequent. Walmart's stock performance was comparatively stable, with fewer significant events affecting prices after market closing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In analyzing the clustering outcomes of Amazon’s stock price, it is evident that Amazon's stock price post-2017 shows two distinct trends: either an upward tendency or a downward tendency. This observation aligns with the prior findings derived from the Descriptive Analysis-Economy, which asserted that "Overall, the period from 2017 to 2021 can be considered as the primary growth phase, while the stock price started to decline in 2022". This conclusion reinforces the assertion that undoubtedly, Amazon's stock price tendency since 2017 exhibits two distinct directions, corroborated by the insights gleaned from the clustering results.
    </p>
  
    <strong>Challenging the Random-Market Hypothesis: Predictability and Influences on Amazon's Stock Prices</strong>
    <p>
      We attempted to test the random-market hypothesis to assess the predictability of stock prices. We considered stock prices as reflections of Amazon's economic performance, speculating that the years following Amazon's epic year (2017) benefited from the actions taken during that period, positively impacting stock prices. However, recognizing that this was a speculative inference based on their behavior, we sought to verify our understanding by testing the hypothesis in the opposite direction. In other words, our null hypothesis assumes that stock prices are random, challenging to predict, and the current prices already reflect past events. Therefore, future prices are influenced by unforeseeable events rather than past occurrences. Contrary to the initial assumption, our results indicate that stock prices are not entirely random and can be predicted to some extent, as demonstrated by the performance of the predictive models used. Additionally, Decision Tree and Random Forest models outperform others, achieving approximately 70% accuracy. These findings contradict the initial assumption of complete randomness in stock prices, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. These results align with our initial speculation that Amazon's actions during the epic year contributed to positive effects on stock prices.

  <h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="news">News Reflection</h2>
  <strong>Strategic Impact of News Reporting</strong><br>
  <p>
    Amazon's news coverage has evolved from technology-focused to more business and market expansion topics. This shift likely reflects Amazon's strategic direction towards global expansion and diversification.The way news portrays Amazon influences public perception, shaping views on its business activities and market success.
</p>
<strong>News Sentiment and Market Reaction</strong><br>
<p>
    Sentiment in news about Amazon, particularly positive sentiment, may be linked to its market performance. Positive public and investor sentiment could boost its stock prices and market standing. Sustained positive news coverage over time might cement consumer and investor trust in Amazon, aiding its long-term growth.
</p>
<strong>Dynamic Association Between News Reporting and Stock Prices</strong><br>
<p>
    The correlation between Amazon's news coverage and its stock prices is not always straightforward. Sometimes, increased news coverage doesn't immediately affect stock prices, possibly due to delayed market responses or the complexity of the news.
</p>
<p>
  A deeper analysis of the correlation between news and stock prices, considering other factors like overall market trends and macroeconomic conditions, can offer richer insights into market dynamics. Future research could delve into how these elements collectively influence Amazon's strategic decisions and market position. As data analysis techniques advance and more historical data becomes available, our understanding of these dynamics and our ability to predict market trends should improve.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, descriptive analysis, sentiment analysis, and a study of the impact on Amazon’s stock price in 2017 reveal a complex interaction between media coverage, public sentiment, and market performance. Compared with 2016, the increase in news reports in 2017 and the strategic shift from technology to market orientation seem to have significantly improved Amazon's market presence and public image. Sentiment analysis further highlights this, with a significant increase in positive sentiment reflecting the successful public acceptance of Amazon’s strategy. However, the relationship between news coverage and stock prices is complex, suggesting that while news is influential, it is only one of many factors driving market dynamics.
